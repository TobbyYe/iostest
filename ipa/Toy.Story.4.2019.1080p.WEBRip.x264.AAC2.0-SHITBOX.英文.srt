19
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,360
It's raining cats and dogs out there!

20
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,160
I hope they make it back all right.

21
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,980
Heads up! Andy's coming!

22
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,910
Andy, time for dinner.

23
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,330
Yes! I'm starving!

24
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,500
Don't forget to wash your hands!

25
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,610
Okay, Mom!

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,260
- Do you see him? - No.

27
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,630
Well, he's done for.

28
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,130
He'll be lost! Forever!

29
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,050
Jessie. Buzz. Slink. Molly's room.

30
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,620
The rest of you, stay put.

31
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,940
Bo!

32
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,190
Situation?

33
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,890
Lost toy. Side yard.

34
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,690
Billy. Goat. Gruff. Raise the blinds.

35
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,560
They have names?

36
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,500
You never told me that.

37
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,990
You never asked.

38
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,740
Where is he?

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,720
There!

40
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,830
How do we reach him?

41
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,800
Operation Pull-Toy!

42
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,430
- Slink! - You got it, Woody!

43
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,370
Barbies!

44
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,420
Go!

45
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:14,720
Flashlight.

46
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,160
Hang on, R.C.!

47
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,250
I ain't got any more slink!

48
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,810
It's beautiful.

49
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,430
I'm so glad to see this old lamp go to a good home.

50
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,380
We've had it since Molly was a baby.

51
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,850
Molly, are you sure it's all right?

52
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,220
- Yeah, I don't want it anymore. - Thank you.

53
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,770
Where's Woody?

54
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,860
Yeah, hi. I think I left my keys here.

55
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:53,920
- Woody. - Quick!

56
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,710
We'll sneak in the hedges before he's back.

57
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,740
Woody, it's okay.

58
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,220
What? No! No, no, no. You can't go!

59
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,000
- What's best for Andy is that... - Woody.

60
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,410
I'm not Andy's toy.

61
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,370
What?

62
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,500
It's time for the next kid.

63
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,390
And thank you again for everything.

64
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,440
I really appreciate it.

65
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,010
My pleasure. I'm glad it all worked out.

66
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,710
You know,

67
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,600
kids lose their toys every day.

68
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,270
Sometimes they get left in the yard or...

69
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,480
put in the wrong box.

70
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,400
And that box gets taken away.

71
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,550
Mom, where's Woody?

72
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,260
Andy! Come inside!

73
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,790
I can't find Woody!

74
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,580
Well, good night.

75
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,150
Goodbye. Drive safe.

76
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,290
There you are.

77
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,440
Mom, I found him! I found him!

78
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,470
Oh, good. Come on and get inside.

Quit shoving.

Everyone, listen. I thought I told you...

118
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,100
when Mom quickly cleans the bedroom like that...

119
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,840
expect to be put in the closet.

120
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,690
How much longer?

121
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,110
Keep it to a dull roar, Rex.

122
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,860
Deep breaths, Jessie. Deep breaths.

123
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,980
Settle down, Slink.

124
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,320
Sit. Good boy!

125
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,650
Sheriff, do I need to be worried?

126
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,860
No, no. My guys are veterans. They'll hang in there.

127
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,950
Good. Just keep them calm until we get word.

128
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,980
Yes, ma'am.

129
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,500
How are you, uh, feeling about today?

130
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,730
Good, good. Yeah, good.

131
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,780
I'm good.

132
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,780
Good.

133
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,670
We're on! Bonnie's done with breakfast!

134
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,260
- Any minute now. - You hear that?

135
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,590
Any minute now.

136
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,760
Wind 'em if you got 'em.

137
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,760
Keep your batteries clean, your joints unlocked...

138
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,890
Thanks, Woody. I got it.

139
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,790
Yes, I'm sorry. You're right, you're right.

140
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,840
The town is open!

141
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,050
Hi, Mayor!

142
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,900
Banker!

143
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,230
Hi, Ice-Cream Man! Hi, Hat Shop Owner!

144
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,110
Mailman!

145
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,890
And the sheriff!

146
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,970
Okay. Bye, toys!

147
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,780
Sheriff Jessie!

148
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,180
Giddy-up, Bullseye!

149
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,610
They went that way!

150
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,610
Chase them!

151
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,960
What a beautiful hat shop!

152
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,630
- You have so many hats... - Wow. They're doing "Hat Shop."

153
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,800
When's the last time we ever got to play that?

154
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,390
Remember when she played "House"?

155
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,300
I liked "House."

156
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,560
Those were the days.

157
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,430
It was basic.

158
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,500
You made a house, you lived in it, done.

159
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,480
That's the third time you haven't been picked this week.

160
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,770
I don't know. I don't keep count.

161
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,420
You don't have to.

162
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,770
- I'll do it for you. - Okay, okay, okay, I get it.

163
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,610
- It's been a while. - Oh, looky there.

164
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,680
You got your first dust bunny.

165
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,700
How adorable.

166
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,950
What you gonna name it?

167
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:15,900
What about Dusty?

168
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,030
- Francis! - Harry!

169
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,080
- Karen! - Fuzzball!

170
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,240
- LeBron. - No, Fluffy.

171
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,830
- How about Thumper? - Tumbleweed!

172
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,790
"Tumbleweed." Oh, that's good. That's good.

173
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,250
He's a cowboy, so that makes a lot of sense.

174
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,790
So many choices.

175
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,340
I just can't decide!

176
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,070
Bonnie?

177
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,710
What are you doing? We got to go.

178
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,010
You don't wanna be late for kindergarten orientation, do you?

179
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,840
But... I don't wanna go.

180
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:36,930
We talked about this.

181
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,140
We're gonna meet your teachers,

182
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,960
- see your classroom... - Can I bring a toy?

183
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,040
Toys don't go to school, that's the rule.

184
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,440
Freeze! Nobody move!

185
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,730
Bonnie always forgets something.

186
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,180
She'll be back any second.

187
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,610
That goes for you, too, Hamm.

188
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:53,800
But it's money!

189
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,360
You all right, Woody?

190
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,660
I'm sure she'll pick you next time.

191
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,030
Come on, I'm fine. No problem.

192
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,080
Woody. Here.

193
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,120
Thanks, Jessie.

194
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,360
We're here for you, buddy.

195
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,420
- I don't want to play the baker. - Pricklepants.

196
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,090
- The hat shop owner is the role I was born to play! - Okay.

197
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,540
All right, Pricklepants, back to your bakery.

198
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,300
Excuse me, Dolly?

199
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,090
Woody, can't you see I'm threatening everyone?

200
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,080
- Go back to the closet. - Yeah, I know. I know. It's just...

201
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,630
I'm worried about Bonnie.

202
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,470
A toy should go with her to orientation.

203
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,680
Didn't you hear Dad? You'll get Bonnie in trouble.

204
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,600
Yeah, but kindergarten is so different.

205
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,180
It can be too much for a kid.

206
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,490
Having a buddy with them to get through it

207
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,520
can really help things.

208
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,600
I remember with Andy, I would go to school with him...

209
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,630
I'm sorry, Woody. I hate to sound like a broken record.

210
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,020
But Bonnie is not Andy.

211
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,690
No, no, no, of course, I get that.

212
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:35,180
- But if you would just... - Places, everyone!

213
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,030
Bonnie?

214
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,660
What are you doing back there?

215
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,320
Come on, we have to go.

216
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,890
That's my big girl.

217
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,080
Come on. We got to hurry, okay?

218
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,670
Don't forget your backpack.

219
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,630
You're gonna have so much fun.

220
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,970
All right. Now what was it you were saying, Woody?

221
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,300
Woody?

222
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,810
Here we are.

224
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,250
Bonnie, honey, it'll be okay.

225
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,330
Hi! Are you Bonnie?

226
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,220
My name is Miss Wendy.

227
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,290
I'm going to be your kindergarten teacher.

228
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:52,400
We have a special place where you can put your backpack.

229
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,510
You want to see?

230
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,880
Here we are, Bonnie. Just for you.

232
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,050
Okay, class,

233
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,800
let's all find a seat at a table...

234
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,660
so we can start craft time.

235
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,220
On the first day of school,

236
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,470
you'll need a place to put your pencils.

237
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,920
So, today, we're going to make pencil holders.

238
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,170
Now, everyone take a cup...

239
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:33,210
and we'll use the art supplies to decorate them.

240
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,130
Hi.

242
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,890
Bonnie. That is so clever.

243
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,780
"Hello, I'm Forky. Nice to meet you!"

244
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,790
Well, hello, Forky, it's nice to meet you.

245
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,020
I'm Miss Wendy.

246
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,040
Mom! Dad! Look what I made!

247
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,490
His name is Forky!

248
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,050
That is so cool!

249
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,910
I finished kindergarten!

250
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,880
No. That was just orientation.

251
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,470
But for being such a brave girl,

252
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,760
we have a surprise for you.

253
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,430
What is it?

254
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,260
Since school doesn't start for another week,

255
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,560
we are going on a road trip!

256
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,440
- Can I bring Forky? - 'Course you can!

257
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,960
Yay!

258
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,850
And they said I shouldn't go to school with Bonnie.

259
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:48,270
We got this kindergarten thing under control, eh?

260
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,770
I can't believe I'm talking to a spork.

261
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:00,960
Hi, toys!

262
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,850
Bye, toys!

263
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,220
He did go to kindergarten!

264
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,100
- I knew it. - No, no, no, guys, listen...

265
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,390
You tryin' to get Bonnie in trouble?

266
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,470
No, of course not!

267
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,890
You could have been confiscated.

268
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,880
- What does that mean - Taken away.

269
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,270
- No! - Or worse.

270
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,290
You could've been lost!

271
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,480
No, no, no, guys, listen.

272
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,150
Bonnie had a great day in class...

273
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,570
and we're going on a road trip.

274
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,680
- Road trip - Vacation!

275
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,030
But then something really weird happened.

276
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,860
Bonnie made a friend in class.

277
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,870
- What a kid. - Oh, she's already making friends.

278
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:34,060
No, no. She literally made a new friend.

279
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,370
It's okay.

280
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,820
Come on out. That's it.

281
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,570
Come on, there you go.

282
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,570
Come on, let's get you out of there.

283
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,820
You got this.

284
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,870
Good. Good.

285
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,340
Everyone, I want you to meet Forky.

286
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,100
- Golly Bob howdy! - Look at that!

287
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,920
Look how long his arms are!

288
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,100
- Trash? - No.

289
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,190
No, toys.

290
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,940
They're all toys.

291
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,870
T-Toy... Trash.

292
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,520
No, no, no.

293
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,070
That's the trash.

294
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,780
These are your friends.

295
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,970
Hi!

296
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:10,810
Trash!

297
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,320
- No, no, it's okay. - Trash!

298
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,230
Woody, I have a question.

299
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,790
Well, actually, not just one,

300
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,790
I have all of them.

301
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,360
I have all the questions.

302
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,170
Why does he want to go to the trash?

303
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,080
- Because he was made from trash. - Trash!

304
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,210
Look, I know this is a little strange, but

305
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,800
- you got to trust me on this. - Trash?

306
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,420
Forky is the

307
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,300
most important toy to Bonnie right now.

308
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,220
Important?

309
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,090
He's a spork.

310
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,220
Yes. Yeah, I know, but this spork...

311
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,430
this toy is crucial to Bonnie

312
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,460
getting adjusted to kindergarten.

313
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,140
Woody, aren't you being a little dramatic about all this?

314
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,690
I know this is new to everybody...

315
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,770
but you should see how much

316
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,690
this little guy means to Bonnie.

317
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,150
When she started playing with him...

318
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,450
she had the biggest smile on her face.

319
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,740
I wish you could have seen it.

320
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,950
Bonnie was really upset...

321
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,700
and I swear, once she made Forky...

322
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,060
it was a complete transformation.

323
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,500
- Woody? - Just a second, Jessie.

324
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,750
So, we all have to make sure nothing happens to him.

325
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,320
Something happened to him.

326
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,400
Chutes and Ladders!

327
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,510
- Trash. - No, no, no! No! No!

328
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,970
You're a toy now, Forky! Come on!

329
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,280
Stop! Stop it!

330
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,090
- No, no, no! Come on! - Trash!

331
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,300
Trash! Trash!

332
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,390
Well, I guess I'll just babysit him

333
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,830
till he's used to the room.

334
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,050
Forky?

335
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,840
Where are you, Forky?

336
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,800
There you are!

337
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,140
I thought I'd lost you, silly.

338
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,940
No, no, no.

339
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,090
Big girl scary!

340
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,840
Like I said before, Bonnie's not scary.

341
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,830
She loves you and you need to...

342
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,470
Forky?

343
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,600
Bonnie!

344
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,560
Let's go!

345
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,100
Rise and shine!

346
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,620
Who wants to go on a road trip?

347
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,210
Me! I'm gonna bring Dolly, and Buttercup...

348
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,480
and Forky, and...

349
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,400
Forky Where are you?

350
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,920
He's got to be here somewhere.

351
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,910
Forky?

352
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,700
Forky!

353
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,340
Come on. Let's eat some breakfast and hit the road!

354
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,000
Let's go, Forky!

355
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,640
He's quite a handful, Woody.

356
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,100
You need help with him on the road trip?

357

No. No, no. I got it, I got it.

358
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,980
We'll just be stuck in an RV.

359
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,050
He can't get far. I got this.

360

I got it.

Hey, Buzz.

410
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,970
You doing okay?

411
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,840
I don't know, Buzz.

412
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,470
I know you weren't around when Andy was little... but

413
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,060
I don't remember it being this hard.

414
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,580
Want me to take the next watch?

415
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,600
I'll keep an eye on Forky.

416
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,650
No, no. I need to do this.

417
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,830
That little voice inside me

418
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,860
would never leave me alone if I gave up.

419
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,070
Who do you think it is?

420
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,280
Who?

421
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,120
The voice inside of you. Who do you think it is?

422
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,200
Me?

423
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,290
You know, my conscience?

424
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,350
That part of you that tells you things?

425
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,670
What you're really thinking?

426
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:35,800
Fascinating.

427
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:39,110
So, your inner voice advises you.

428
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,930
What?

429
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,160
It's a secret mission in uncharted space.

430
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,970
Let's go.

431
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:49,980
Where's Forky?

432
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,190
Oh, no! Forky!

433
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,020
Forky!

434
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:54,650
Forky!

435
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,670
I am not a toy!

436
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,590
I'm a spork.

437
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,340
Be quiet!

438
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,960
I was made for soup, salad...

439
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,620
maybe chili, and then the trash.

440
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,090
I'm litter!

441
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,120
Freedom!

442
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,510
Hamm, how far to our next stop?

443
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,560
5.32 miles, give or take.

444
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,680
I can make that.

445
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:13,980
I'll meet you at the RV park.

446
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,130
Woody, hold on a minute. Woody!

447
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,690
Forky!

448
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,280
Forky, where are you?

449
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,900
Forky!

450
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,660
Forky, where are you?

451
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,180
- Carry me - No.

452
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,690
Why do I have to be a toy?

453
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,780
Because you have Bonnie's name

454
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,570
written on the bottom of your sticks.

455
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:08,740
Why do I have Bonnie's name

456
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,270
written on the bottom of my sticks?

457
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:11,520
Because she...

458
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:17,150
Look, she plays with you all the time, right?

459
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,500
Yes.

460
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,460
And who does she sleep with every night?

461
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,920
The big white fluffy thing?

462
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,160
No, not her pillow.

463
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,870
You.

464
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,800
All right, Forky.

465
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,410
You have to understand how lucky you are right now.

466
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,060
You're Bonnie's toy.

467
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,390
You are going to help create happy memories...

468
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,090
that will last for the rest of her life.

469
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,170
What?

470
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,770
Okay. Doing it for Bonnie.

471
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,320
Doing this for Bonnie, you're doing it for Bonnie.

472
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,530
Okay, like it or not, you are a toy.

473
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,160
Maybe you don't like being one,

474
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,620
but you are one nonetheless.

475
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,020
Which means you are going to be there for Andy when he...

476
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,020
Who's Andy?

477
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,290
I mean, Bonnie.

478
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,080
You have to be there for Bonnie.

479
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,690
That is your job.

480
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,210
Well, what's your job?

481
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,960
Well, right now, it's to make sure you do yours.

482
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,490
- Carry me - No.

483
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,620
Who's Andy?

484
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,580
Andy was my other kid.

485
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,590
You had another kid?

486
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,020
Yeah, yeah.

487
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,510
For a long time.

488
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,720
And it was pretty great.

489
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,720
I was a favorite toy, actually.

490
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,350
Running the room was my job.

491
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,870
Keeping all the toys in place...

492
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:37,060
So, he thought Andy's room was a planet?

493
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,250
- That is messed up. - Right!

494
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,120
That's exactly what I thought when he first showed up.

495
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:43,880
Yeah. I mean, how is that not annoying?

496
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,170
- Thank you! - Seriously, that is the...

497
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,760
Well, then you watch 'em grow up

498
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,820
and become a full person.

499
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,080
And then they leave.

500
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,830
They go off and do things you'll never see.

501
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,820
Don't get me wrong, you still feel good about it.

502
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,530
But then somehow you find yourself,

503
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,030
after all those years...

504
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:07,480
sitting in a closet just feeling...

505
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:08,360
Useless?

506
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,940
Yeah.

507
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,900
Your purpose fulfilled?

508
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,610
Exactly.

509
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:17,280
Woody, I know what your problem is.

510
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,000
You do?

511
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,410
You're just like me.

512
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,920
Trash!

513
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,840
What is it with you and trash?

514
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,260
- It's warm. - Ew.

515
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,680
- It's cozy. - I guess.

516
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,640
And safe!

517
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,470
Like somebody's whispering in your ear,

518
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,500
"Everything's gonna be okay."

519
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,670
Forky, that's it.

520
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,650
That's how Bonnie feels when she's with you.

521
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,380
- She does - Yes!

522
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,510
Wait a sec.

523
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,860
- You mean she thinks I'm warm? - Yep.

524
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,200
- And cozy - Uh-huh.

525
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,560
And sometimes kinda squishy?

526
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,270
Well, that, too. Yes.

527
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,900
I get it now.

528
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,120
I'm Bonnie's trash.

529
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,250
Yes! Wait, what?

530
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,660
I am Bonnie's trash!

531
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,460
No, no, no, not exactly.

532
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,960
She must be feeling awful without me.

533
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,740
Woody, we got to get going, she needs me!

534
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,030
Hey, Bonnie, I'm coming!

535
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,710
Forky, slow down! Forky!

536
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,950
Bonnie, I'm coming!

537
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,030
Forky!

541
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:29,060
Forky, look. Bonnie's right over there.

542
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:29,850
Hurry!

543
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,170
Woody?

544
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,510
Bo?

545
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:08,980
Woody?

546
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:16,370
Aren't we, aren't we going to Bonnie?

547
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,990
I know, I know. But my friend might be in there.

548
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:19,820
Friend?

549
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,910
A friend, uh... Well, a friend is...

550
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,090
Well, a friend is like you and me.

551
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,010
- Trash - Trash, like... Yes.

552
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,920
And I'm very worried that she might be lost.

553
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:31,090
But, Woody, Bonnie's right there.

554
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,500
Yeah, we'll have you back before she wakes up. Come on.

556
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:43,890
Bo?

557
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:45,470
Bo?

558
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:48,390
Bo?

559
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:49,220
Bo?

560
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,940
Bo?

561
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,520
Bo?

562
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,810
Bo?

563
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,020
Bo.

564
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:58,150
Bo, Bo, Bo...

565
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,240
Bo, Bo, Bo...

566
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:01,700
- Bo? - Bo?

567
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,210
Bo, Bo, Bo...

568
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,670
Bo, Bo, Bo...

569
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,050
Can we go back to Bonnie now?

570
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,300
I don't see your friend.

571
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,660
Yeah, okay.

572
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,040
She's not in here.

573
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,330
Come on, let's go.

574
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,090
Is that Bo?

575
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,140
Hey, howdy.

576
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,180
Hey there.

577
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,660
Sorry to bother you, but...

578
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,480
Why, you're not a bother at all.

579
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,150
We were just out for my early morning stroll.

580
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,860
And look... we met you!

581
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,710
My name is Gabby Gabby.

582
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:47,240
And this is my very good friend Benson.

583
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,380
Woody. Pleasure to meet you.

584
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,250
Well, it's nice to meet you, Woody. And you are...?

585
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,660
This is Forky.

586
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,550
I'm trash.

587
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,540
Our kid made him.

588
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,210
Kid? Toys around here don't have kids.

589
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,630
Are you two lost?

590
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,480
Lost No, no.

591
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,920
But we are looking for a lost toy.

592
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,070
She's a figurine. Used to be on that lamp in the window?

593
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,230
Name's Bo Peep?

594
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,030
Bo Peep?

595
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,390
- Oh, yes, I know Bo. - You do?

596
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,110
Hop on in. We'll take you to her.

597
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,520
You don't have to do that.

598
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,310
Well, okay.

599
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:21,520
Benson, be careful with our new friends.

600
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,690
What service.

601
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,920
Thank you for your help.

602
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,430
I haven't seen Bo in years.

603
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,250
May I ask, when were you made?

604
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,080
Me?

605
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,630
I'm not sure. Late '50s?

606
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,500
Me, too!

607
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,730
Gee, I wonder if we were made in the same factory.

608
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,130
Wouldn't that be something?

609
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,770
I got to say, you are in great condition.

610
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:49,840
Well, I try to stay active.

611
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,140
And look at that,

612
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,890
you have a voice box like me.

613
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,100
Benson, show him.

614
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,980
That's really not necessary.

615
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:02,820
I'm Gabby Gabby

616
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,940
and I love you.

617
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,610
You need to fix that.

618
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,360
My record works just fine.

619
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,570
It's the voice box that's broken.

620
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,120
Does yours still work?

621
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,700
There's a snake in my boot!

622
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,930
Listen to that! Let's see it.

623
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,010
I bet it's the same type.

624
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:21,080
No, thanks, mine's sewn inside.

625
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,170
Is Bo around here? Because we need...

626
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,630
The store is about to open.

627
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,230
Don't worry, we'll take you where no one will see us.

628
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,850
Oh, no. We can't stay.

629
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,680
Yes, you can.

630
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,080
We got to go.

631
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,900
You can't leave yet. You have what I need.

632
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,620
Right inside there.

633
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,090
Returned that lamp the next day.

634
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:55,880
You're kidding me!

635
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,880
Mom, can we go to the park now?

636
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,910
Harmony!

637
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,710
Stop him, please.

638
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,970
What's going on?

639
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,900
Come on! Let's go!

640
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,980
He's coming, he's coming! I see him!

641
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,560
Forky We got to get out of...

642
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:23,270
Woody!

643
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:32,380
I'd like to join your posse, boys.

644
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,410
But first, I'm gonna sing a little song.

645
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,220
Grandma, look what I found.

646
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,100
- Can I take it to the park - Sure.

647
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,890
Mom, she has enough toys from the store.

648
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:50,970
It's fine. Nobody buys the toys anyway.

649
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,800
Thanks, Grandma!

651
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,530
Mom, can we go to the carnival?

652
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:00,890
We're going to the park.

653
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,310
Maybe later, sweetie.

655
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,660
Any sign of Woody?

656
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:11,740
I don't see him!

657
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,130
Maybe we should have gone with the fork.

658
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,280
The spoon is safer.

659
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,080
Forky?

660
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:25,040
Where's Forky?

661
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,130
Mom! Dad!

662
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,270
- What's wrong, honey? - Are you okay?

663
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:30,640
I can't find Forky! He's missing!

664
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,390
Bonnie, it'll be all right.

665
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,020
I'm sure he's here somewhere.

666
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,230
You know, if you don't find him,

667
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,230
you can make a new one.

668
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,930
No! There's only one Forky!

669
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,070
Let's go look outside.

670
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:43,020
Maybe he fell on the ground somewhere.

671
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,740
Poor Bonnie.

672
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,910
We're gonna find him, okay?

673
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:48,580
We have to find him, Mom. He needs me.

674
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,540
Woody was right.

675
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,620
We all should have been safeguarding the utensil.

676
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,110
Why isn't Woody back yet?

677
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,170
Do you think he's lost?

678
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:54,960
Buzz, what do we do?

679
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,880
What do we do, Buzz?

680
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,920
Buzz, what do we do?

681
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,800
What do we do, Buzz?

682
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,380
- What do we do, Buzz Buzz! - I, uh...

683
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,040
- Buzz. - What would Woody do?

684
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,590
Jump out of a moving vehicle.

685
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,790
What would Woody do?

686
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,640
It's a secret mission in uncharted space.

687
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,290
Let's go!

688
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,270
I think I have to go.

689
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,640
- Where - Where you goin' Why?

690
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,350
Should we all go?

691
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,020
- Are we going? - And then what?

692
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,730
No time to explain! Attack!

693
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,010
No time to explain!

694
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:18,360
- Oh, no! - Buzz!

695
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,930
Okay, what is with everyone jumping out the window?

696
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,400
Woody and Forky were last seen on the highway.

697
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,860
But where is the highway?

698
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,540
The slingshot maneuver is all we've got!

699
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,610
Full speed ahead!

700
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:41,240
Thanks, inner voice!

701
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,380
The highway.

702
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,760
On my way, Woody!

703
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:14,690
Rad.

704
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:17,790
Step right up!

705
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:18,420
Put your money down!

706
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,030
Get yourself a real Buzz Lightyear!

707
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,470
Harmony, honey. Sunscreen.

708
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,420
Okay.

709
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,420
Be right back, Mr. Cowboy.

710
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,890
Okay. Antique store, antique store...

711
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,140
That way!

712
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,540
Did you see 'em? How many are there?

713
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:08,000
We got a busload of campers!

714
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,080
Here they come!

715
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,420
Playtime, baby!

716
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,860
Baby! It's a good day to play, huh?

717
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,640
Am I right?

718
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,780
"Hello, Mr. Cowboy. How are you today?"

719
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,910
"Do you like riding horses?"

720
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,960
Wanna play on the swings?

721
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,960
Wait for me!

722
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:01,300
Bo?

723
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:02,800
Come on.

724
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,520
Bo!

725
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,200
I can't believe it's you!

726
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,120
Bo Peep!

727
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,150
I never thought I'd see you again!

728
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,320
- So, which kid is yours? - Which one is yours?

729
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,450
- None. - No one.

730
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,660
- Wait, you're a lost toy? - You're a lost toy?

731
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,330
- That's great. - That's awful.

732
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,970
I mean, awfully great...

733
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:34,710
that you are lost out here.

734
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,210
- Skunk, skunk, skunk! - Watch out!

735
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,810
I told you not to drive so fast.

736
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,300
You almost ran him over.

737
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:47,890
Hey, guys!

738
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,970
Hold on there!

739
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,850
Okay! I missed you, too.

740
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,560
If it isn't Bobby Gus?

741
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,440
Lefty?

742
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,080
Billy, Goat, and Gruff.

743
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,020
Right! Right! Right! Sorry, guys.

744
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,360
- Girls. - Girls! Of course!

745
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,360
All right, all right.

746
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:07,590
Okay, let's get a look at you. You need any repairs?

747
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,330
Repairs No, I'm fine.

748
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,580
Nice find, girls.

749
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,630
Where did you get all this stuff?

750
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,260
Here and there.

751
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,430
You know, some kids play rougher than others...

752
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:18,720
so I try to be prepared.

753
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,470
How long have you been out on your own?

754
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,730
Seven fantastic years!

755
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:23,270
Seven?

756
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,970
You would not believe the things I've seen.

757
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,050
No.

758
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:27,930
Gigs.

759
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,550
Come on out. There's someone I want you to meet.

760
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,010
Be right down.

761
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,980
What's the situation? We heading out of town or...

762
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,940
Who's this?

763
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,330
You remember the rag doll I told you about?

764
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,410
- The cowboy - Yep!

765
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,150
No way!

766
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,740
- Don't stare. - I'm totally staring.

767
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:52,240
Woody, this is Giggle McDimples.

768
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,410
Hi, Giggle.

770
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,830
You didn't tell me he was a cop.

771
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,010
Howdy, Sheriff.

772
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,640
Officer Giggle McDimples.

773
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,600
I run Pet Patrol for Mini-Opolis.

774
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,720
Yeah, search and rescue.

775
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:03,980
Ants, caterpillars,

776
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,640
miniature poodles, spiders.

777
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,230
Carl! Where you headed?

778
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:09,360
Combat Carl just heard there's a birthday party...

779
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,730
at the playground on Main Street.

780
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:12,570
Rumor has it they got two pinatas.

781
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,740
- That could be 20 to 30 kids. - Nice!

782
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:17,730
Oh, yeah! Combat Carl's gettin' played with!

783
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,620
You guys in?

784
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,480
You bet! Woody, you are gonna love this!

785
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,190
No, I can't, sir.

786
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:26,160
Bo, I need to get back to my kid.

787
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:26,820
What?

788
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:27,920
You got a kid?

789
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,650
Yeah.

790
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,360
Way to beat the odds, soldier.

791
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,830
Meet you at the playground, Peep.

792
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,340
Combat Carl's got a pinata party to crash.

793
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,120
All right, move out. Hut! Hut! Hut!

794
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,500
So, you're, uh, with a kid?

795
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,680
It's not Andy, is it?

796
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,680
No, no, no. He went off to college.

797
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,170
But he gave us to Bonnie.

798
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:48,650
- You have a little girl. - No way!

799
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,270
Yeah, yeah. It's why I'm out here.

800
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,480
Her other toy is trapped

801
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,980
in this antique store, and I have to...

802
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,810
Second Chance Antiques?

803
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,150
We know that store.

804
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,820
That's great. That is great!

805
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,320
If you know the store, you could really

806
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,440
- help me find him... - No way.

807
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:01,620
We wasted years there,

808
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,730
just sitting on the shelf, collecting dust.

809
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,020
Bo, that's awful.

810
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,440
But I don't have a choice.

811
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,190
I have to get that toy from Gabby.

812
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,960
Steer clear of that weirdo.

813
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,210
If I were you, I'd cut my losses and go home.

814
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:14,420
But Bonnie needs him to get through kindergarten.

815
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,760
Kids lose toys every day. Bonnie will get over it.

816
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,370
No, no...

817
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:21,870
You see, Bonnie needs him just like Molly needed you.

818
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,970
No. Sorry, girls.

819
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:26,300
Molly's not here.

820
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,690
Molly Bo, I didn't know you had a kid.

821
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,050
That was a long time ago.

822
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,720
Bo's kid was something special.

823
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,650
She was the cutest thing...

824
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:36,810
but so afraid of the dark.

825
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,280
It was just a phase.

826
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,820
You weren't there in the beginning.

827
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,600
Hearing Molly cry each night...

828
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,810
it broke every toy's heart.

829
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:47,320
And then, Bo came into the room.

830
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,570
Her lamp was the only thing that made Molly feel safe.

831
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,460
Mom would let her keep Bo on all night.

832
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,630
Ha! Who knew you were such a softy?

833
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,880
And Molly would fall asleep

834
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,260
with her hand resting on Bo's feet.

835
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,620
Okay! Okay. I get it.

836
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:05,630
Bo, my kid really needs this toy.

837
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:09,170
Will you help me? For old times' sake.

838
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,520
All right, all right.

839
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,380
Thank you!

840
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,520
- Thank you! - All right.

841
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,430
Guess we're doing this. Let's ride!

842
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,810
Second Chance Antiques, and step on it.

844
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,380
Benson, are we finished?

845
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,680
That feels great!

846
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,350
Look at that! Good as new.

847
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:54,220
Yeah. Thank you, uh, Benson.

848
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:58,230
So, um, when's Woody coming back?

849
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,890
Like I said, soon.

850
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,440
He won't forget about you.

851
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:02,320
How do you know?

852
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,810
You have your child's name written on your feet.

853
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,310
Sticks.

854
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:08,790
That makes you a very important toy.

855
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:10,570
That's exactly what Woody says.

856
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,330
Interesting.

857
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:13,830
Hi, Grandma! We're back!

858
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:14,740
She's back.

859
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,200
Who is she?

860
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,120
Harmony.

861
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,950
Wait a second... she took Woody.

862
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,340
Did she lose him?

863
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:26,500
No. My Harmony is perfect.

864
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,510
Forky, it's tea time. It's tea time.

865
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,630
What is tea time?

866
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:35,670
I'll show you.

868
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:40,680
A little bit of milk, two lumps of sugar.

869
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:49,480
I've been practicing. How do I look?

870
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,690
A little higher.

871
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,780
Stick out your pinky.

872
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,280
Nice!

873
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,570
Delicious!

874
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,540
Harmony, sweetie, I'm leaving.

875
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,800
Come give me a hug.

876
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,120
Bye, Mom. I love you.

877
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,050
When my voice box is fixed...

878
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,140
I'll finally get my chance.

879
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,610
Now, about our friend Woody.

880
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:39,580
I wanna know everything about him.

881
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,540
Oh, yeah, Woody.

882
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,840
I've known that guy my whole life. Two days!

883
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,090
Hey, did you know that Bonnie was not his first kid?

884
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:47,290
He had this other kid, Andy.

885
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,120
And you know what?

886
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:02,890
Hey, Lightyear.

887
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,850
Hey, up here, Astro-boy.

888
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:06,650
If you think you can just show up

889
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,610
and take our top prize spot...

890
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:09,660
- you're wrong! - Dead wrong!

891
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,490
You don't understand. I'm trying to...

892
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:13,740
Cheat the system and get with a kid. Yeah, we know.

893
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,160
No, I need...

894
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,410
A child to shower you with unconditional love?

895
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,830
Join the club, pal.

896
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:19,540
Yeah, join the club!

897
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,130
Come on, help me get outta here.

898
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:23,030
I'll help you. With my foot!

899
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,070
Get him.

900
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:25,990
Get him.

901
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,330
Bunny, what are you doing?

902
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:29,750
I can't reach him. Help me out here, come on.

903
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,220
Sorry, Ducky. I'm not a mind reader, you know.

904
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,750
What's not to understand, hmm?

905
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,000
You gonna make me say it?

906
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:35,500
What?

907
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:37,680
With these tiny legs,

908
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:39,420
I cannot reach without your help.

909
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:40,400
Okay This is what

910
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,440
I've been talking about, Bunny.

911
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,770
You need to work on paying attention

912
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:43,840
and your listening skills.

913
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,720
How you like that, cheater?

914
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:48,560
Yeah!

915
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,020
To infinity and my foot! Boom!

916
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:55,980
In a galaxy far, far away, you got kicked in the head!

917
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:57,570
How do I get out of here?

918
00:43:58,370 --> 00:43:59,620
This planet is toxic.

919
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,360
Closing helmet to conserve oxygen.

920
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:04,160
In the vacuum of space, they cannot hear you scream!

921
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:06,000
Let go of me!

922
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:06,780
Get off of me!

923
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,090
So, that's what gravity feel like.

924
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:11,290
Yeah, that's it.

925
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,160
Where you going?

926
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:14,890
You better get over here, spaceman!

927
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:16,250
Yeah, put us back up there!

928
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,430
Bunny, what are you doing? He's getting away, let's go!

929
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:19,710
- I'm trying! - Come on!

930
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,150
Antique store, here we come!

931
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:26,070
Bo, why do you ride around in a skunk?

932
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:26,600
Skunk!

933
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:28,810
A skunk!

934
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,110
I get it. Smart.

935
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,850
Corndogs, corndogs, corndogs!

936
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,530
Why are you so bad at driving?

937
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:41,860
You got six eyes.

938
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:44,030
Thanks for the landing.

939
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:46,410
Come on, follow me.

940
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,800
- I'm fine. - His face!

941
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,470
- That's hilarious. - I'm fine. Don't worry.

942
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:56,790
Happens all the time.

943
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:57,500
Tape!

944
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,310
Not a bad hiding spot.

945
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:00,980
Yeah. Leave the skunk.

946
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:02,270
- We'll fix it later. - 10-4.

947
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:03,900
This will be more fun.

948
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,340
Let's get you to that store!

949
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:09,360
Okay, spill it. The cowboy, what's the deal?

950
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,740
- There's no deal. - Uh-huh.

951
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:13,240
Don't do this to yourself. Cowboy's got a kid.

952
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,160
- Giggle... - Trust me. I've been there.

953
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,480
You know about me and He-Man. I'm not proud.

954
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,440
Here he comes!

955
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:20,620
- Oh, man... - What?

956
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:21,780
No, not you.

957
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:24,250
Second Chance Antiques, straight ahead.

959
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:25,710
Heavy foot traffic at the entrance.

960
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:28,410
- Easiest way in is...the roof. - The roof!

961
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:30,870
Let's go antiquing.

963
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,790
How did you end up here?

964
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:42,560
I thought you were given to a new family.

965
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,730
You know how it goes.

966
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:45,100
Their little girl grew up

967
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,220
and didn't need me anymore, so...

968
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:49,180
I'm sorry, Bo.

969
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:51,320
Who needs a kid's room...

970
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:55,560
when you can have all of this?

971
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,540
Whatcha looking at, Sheriff?

972
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:10,780
What? Oh, uh...

973
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,920
That wasn't... No, uh, nothing.

974
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,880
I was looking at the store. Right there.

975
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:17,460
I was looking at the antique store.

976
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,760
- Giggle, count us down. - Five.

977
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,680
- Countdown for what? - Four.

978
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,000
- You want to get to the store, don't you? - Three. Two. One!

979
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:36,560
The highway exit has to be somewhere.

980
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:37,980
Where is it?

981
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:39,810
Meteor shower! Look out!

982
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:41,860
Woody?

983
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:43,770
Good work, inner voice.

984
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:46,660
So, how about you? How's your new kid?

985
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:49,040
Bonnie? Oh, she's great.

986
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,250
Jessie is loving it.

987
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:51,380
Jessie's still with you?

988
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,370
Oh, yeah, the whole gang's still together.

989
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:55,620
Well, I mean, most of us.

990
00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:58,590
What about Rex?

991
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:00,930
Yeah, yeah, Rex, Bullseye, Slinky...

992
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:02,560
- the Potato Heads... - Buzz?

993
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,810
Yeah, Buzz, too.

994
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:06,810
I cannot wait to see his face when he hears that I found...

995
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:08,510
- Bo Peep? - Buzz!

996
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:10,480
- My old moving buddy! - Buzz?

997
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,770
It's so good to see you!

998
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:13,010
Woody, it's Bo Peep!

999
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,510
- What are you doing here? - What are you doing here?

1000
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,390
Buzz... Buzz... Buzz...

1001
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:18,610
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

1002
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:20,070
- Three years! - Three years!

1003
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:21,570
That's how long we've been hanging up there

1004
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:22,580
waiting for a kid!

1005
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:23,620
Look, I'm sorry about that.

1006
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:25,820
You ruined our lives. Shame on you!

1007
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,360
Who are these guys?

1008
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:29,120
- Lightyear promised us a kid. - You did what?

1009
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,360
I did not.

1010
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:32,280
- Wait a minute! - Eat my plush!

1011
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:33,750
All right now, come on, stop it!

1012
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:34,500
Cut it out now!

1013
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:35,590
Come on, guys, break it up.

1014
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:37,120
Guys, I have a kid!

1015
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,050
You got a kid?

1016
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:40,340
Like a kid-kid?

1017
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,800
Like a human kid, not a baby goat?

1018
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:45,010
Yeah. Now let go of Buzz and come with me.

1019
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:46,220
I'll take you to Bonnie.

1020
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,850
- We're gettin' a kid! - Yes!

1021
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:48,710
We're gettin' a kid?

1022
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:50,900

1023

Forky's gone.

1031
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:09,190
Honey, I'm sorry.

1032
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:11,750
Okay. Let's look outside one more time.

1033
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:13,910
But then we have to keep driving, okay?

1034
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:18,800
They're about to leave!

1035
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,330
- Leaving? - They can't do that!

1036
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,500
The panic is attacking me!

1037
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,850
- Watch it, buddy! - What do we do?

1038
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:26,310
- We have to stop them! - How?

1039
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:28,980
We could frame Dad for a crime so he goes to jail.

1040
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,310
Or go back in time and warn Woody about the future.

1041
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:33,190
That's crazy. Time is a flat circle.

1042
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:33,840
Jessie!

1043
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:39,180
I'm sorry, Bonnie.

1044
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,150
We looked everywhere.

1045
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,700
But we need to get going now, okay?

1046
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,160
Can we please leave a note for Forky...

1047
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,650
so he knows where we're going?

1048
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,730
He has to go to kindergarten.

1049
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,860
Are you kidding me, I can't...

1050
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:55,110
Everything is going perfect... I just...

1051
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:57,750
Okay! Daddy's going to use some words.

1052
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,420
How about we go to the carnival?

1053
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:01,450
Or maybe check out some of those shops in town?

1054
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,470
What did you do?

1055
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:05,920
We're not going anywhere.

1057
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:08,890
- Brilliant! - That was genius!

1058
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:09,970
Nice work, Jessie!

1059
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,630
I'm sure Buzz and Woody are on their way back right now.

1060
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:18,760
Forky is in there?

1061
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,470
Yeah.

1062
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:20,890
Now, hold on. I have a question.

1063
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:23,860
Who will Bonnie love more? Ducky or me. Say me.

1064
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,280
- No, say Ducky. Ducky. - Bunny. Bunny.

1065
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,570
Okay, guys. Playtime is over.

1066
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,020
You have to follow my lead.

1067
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,080
We stay together, we stay quiet. Are we clear?

1068
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,530
Absolutely. Lead the way.

1069
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:55,730
- Are you kidding me. - Move over.

1070
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:57,270
- You move over. - Quit pushing me.

1071
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:57,930
Stop.

1072
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,910
Oh, my maker! That sheep has three heads!

1073
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:01,530
No, no, no!

1074
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:04,200
What all six eyes just looked into my soul.

1075
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,580
Gonna have nightmares.

1076
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:13,380
That's most likely where your Forky is being kept.

1077
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,050
All right, this isn't so bad.

1078
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:17,090
We just can't be seen by the dummies.

1079
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:18,470
Not just the dummies.

1080
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:22,180
Her cabinet is surrounded by a moat of exposed aisle.

1081
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:24,310
Where Dragon roams.

1082
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:26,770
- We can handle a cat. - No.

1083
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:27,890
Not this one.

1084
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:34,780
Is that how we look on the inside?

1085
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:36,820
There's so much... fluff.

1086
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,320
So, how do you propose we get up there?

1087
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,610
We could go straight across.

1088
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,370
- How. - That's quite a jump.

1089
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:44,700
We know the perfect toy to help.

1090
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:45,740
Bonnie, check it out.

1091
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:47,830
- Look at all this cool stuff. - Bonnie?

1092
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,420
We got to get Forky now!

1093
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:50,370
Woody, don't...

1094
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,130
- Stick to the plan. - 10-4.

1095
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:53,670
- Follow me. - Roger that.

1096
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:01,760
Woody just sits in the closet? With no playtime?

1097
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,140
Yeah, he told me himself, he's useless.

1098
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,180
That's awful.

1099
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:07,060
Such pretty hair...

1100
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:08,680
What are you doing?

1101
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:09,770
You need to stick to the plan.

1102
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:11,520
But it's Bonnie. She's right...

1103
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,310
Can we go to the carnival, too?

1104
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,020
There.

1105
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:16,480
Come on. Stay quiet.

1106
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,490
You better hope the dummies didn't...

1107
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,900
My sheep!

1108
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,530
What did I say? I lead. You follow.

1109
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:09,240
Bo, I'm so sorry. Really.

1110
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:10,370
Just tell me how to help.

1111
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:11,210
You really wanna help?

1112
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:14,170
Then stay out of my way. I'm getting my sheep back.

1113
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:15,080
What about the others?

1114
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,750
Giggle knows what to do.

1115
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:22,050
- Here you go. - That's our objective.

1116
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:23,590
We have to get that key.

1117
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:25,430
It's the only way inside the cabinet.

1118
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:26,890
You can't be serious.

1119
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:28,560
How are we supposed to do that?

1120
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,470
Okay.

1121
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:30,930
You know what, leave that to us.

1122
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:32,770
We know exactly what to do.

1123
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,230
Where did you two come from?

1124
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:40,320
The keys! Give 'em up now! Where are they?

1125
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,610
Give us the keys! Give us the keys!

1126
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:43,700
Well, we're not doing that.

1127
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,030
Yeah, yeah, I agree, too visible.

1128
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:46,820
It's a good point. Something more subtle.

1129
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,370
What about "winner, winner, chicken dinner"?

1130
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:49,290
Yes.

1131
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:57,540
The keys! Give 'em up now! Where are they?

1132
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:00,050
- You're kidding. - Really?

1133
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:01,710
Okay, okay. You just...

1134
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:03,010
All right. Well...

1135
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:05,130
What about the old "Plush Rush"?

1136
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:06,260
There you go!

1137
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:21,780
- Where is this going? - Don't interrupt.

1138
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:37,790
Okay, right?

1139
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:40,040
Not gonna happen. N-O.

1140
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,210
Okay, do you want the key or not?

1141
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:43,090
What is wrong with you?

1142
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:43,880
What is wrong with...?

1143
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,300
We just gave you three brilliant ideas.

1144
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,590
It's one thing to say no.

1145
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:49,340
It's another to offer a reason...

1146
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:51,310
How do we get that key?

1147
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,600
You're kidding!

1148
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:00,520
Really?

1149
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,770
Woody's back?

1150
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:02,690
Woody's back?

1151
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:04,650
And you're sure it's Bo Peep who's with him?

1152
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,530
Thank you, Benson.

1153
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:09,200
Make sure the others are ready.

1154
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:11,870
Woody's back!

1155
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:13,740
I'm coming, Bonnie!

1156
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:15,830
Bonnie.

1157
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:18,120
First, we must prepare for his arrival.

1158
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:18,710
Prepare?

1159
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:20,670
Have you ever played hide-and-seek?

1160
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:23,170
No. But it sounds complicated.

1161
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:23,840
It's easy.

1162
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,590
- I'll teach you, okay? - Okay.

1163
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:27,340
The first thing you do is...

1164
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:29,970
- one of us finds a place to hide... - Scary.

1165
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:31,260
the other one...

1166
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:52,620
What are we doing.

1167
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:56,580
Just stand there and be quiet!

1168
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,500
I'll do the talking.

1169
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:05,670
Hi, Tinny!

1170
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:08,130
Nice to see you, too.

1171
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:10,470
Yeah, he's with me.

1172
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:12,340
My friend? No, no, no.

1173
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,890
He's my accessory.

1174
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,390
- Hey, guys. - Bo!

1175
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:18,270
Long time no see.

1176
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:20,020
Couldn't take it out there, huh?

1177
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:21,600
Hey, Doug. Saw your better half

1178
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,690
at the front of the store.

1179
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:24,900
Yeah, you mess with the cat, you get the claws.

1180
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:25,940
Bo came back!

1181
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:27,280
Magic 8-Ball was right!

1182
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,490
- Excuse me. Sorry. - What are you doing here?

1183
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:31,820
I thought the store had no return policy!

1184
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:32,950
Bo, help me out.

1185
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:34,370
I need a battery.

1186
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:37,370
We got to get this wagon train a-movin'!

1187
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:38,870
- Agreed. - Help, help, help.

1188
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:39,830
Cheater.

1189
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:41,080
Have you seen Duke?

1190
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,710
He's in the back.

1191
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,470
Look who jumped 40 school buses

1192
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:54,180
and landed back into my life.

1193
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:56,220
- Hi, Duke! - Who's the cowboy?

1194
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,350
Duke, meet Woody. Woody, meet...

1195
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:01,190
Duke Caboom. Canada's greatest stuntman.

1196
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:02,690
Oh, yeah!

1197
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,480
He's posing.

1198
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,480
Duke?

1199
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:10,610
- Duke, we need to... - Hold on. One more.

1200
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:13,360
Yeah! What brings you back, Peep?

1201
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:14,410
We need your help.

1202
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:17,700
Gabby Gabby has his toy and my sheep.

1203
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,790
No. Billy, Goat, and Gruff?

1204
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:21,330
Those are my girls.

1205
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,830
What were you doing getting tangled up with Gabby Gabby?

1206
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:24,500
You know better.

1207
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,040
Yeah, some toy thought it would be a good idea...

1208
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,340
to wander into the aisle.

1209
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:29,840
That doesn't make any sense.

1210
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:30,880
It doesn't, does it?

1211
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,550
Everybody knows the best route is behind the shelves.

1212
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:36,220
That would have been a better route, wouldn't it?

1213
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:37,850
This toy sounds like a complete idiot.

1214
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:39,600
He does!

1215
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:41,770
Wait, are you that toy?

1216
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:43,390
So, here's the plan.

1217
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:46,100
We need to jump over the aisle to Gabby's cabinet.

1218
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:49,070
- And you are the toy to do it. - No.

1219
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:49,980
- Duke. - Nope.

1220
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:50,860
- Duke. - Never.

1221
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:51,570
- Duke. - No way.

1222
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:52,280
- Duke. - Pass.

1223
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,030
- Duke. - Negative.

1224
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:54,280
- Duke. - Rejected.

1225
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,530
Please, Mr. Caboom, this is really important.

1226
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:57,530
My kid...

1227
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:58,990
You have a kid?

1228
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:03,120
Hey, Duke, show us some more poses, what do you say?

1229
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,210
- I had a kid. - Oh, no.

1230
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:06,210
Rejean.

1231
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,090
Rejean was so excited when he got me after Christmas.

1232
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,670
It was the happiest Boxing Day of my life.

1233
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:15,840
That's Duke Caboom,

1234
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:18,470
riding the amazing Caboom stunt cycle!

1235
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:19,760
Caboom!

1236
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,430
I was ready to finally do what I was made to do.

1237
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:25,270
Caboom!

1238
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:27,150
But when Rejean realized I couldn't jump

1239
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:29,230
as far as the toy in the commercial...

1240
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:33,150
It's a commercial! It's not real!

1241
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:34,780
Rejean threw me away!

1242
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:36,110
It's not fair!

1243
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:38,030
Why, Rejean Why?

1244
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:43,040
Okay, okay. Calm down, Duke.

1245
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,870
That was a long time ago.

1246
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,080
Right now, we need the only toy

1247
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,920
who can crash us onto Gabby's cabinet.

1248
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:50,630
Crash?

1249
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:51,460
Crash?

1250
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,800
Any Duke Caboom toy can land...

1251
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:57,880
but you are the only one that can crash the way you do.

1252
00:57:57,890 --> 00:57:59,550
- I am? - Yes!

1253
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:01,970
Forget Rejean. Forget your commercial.

1254
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:04,350
Be the Duke you are right now...

1255
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:07,940
the one who jumps and crashes!

1256
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:14,690
Be who I am right now.

1257
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:17,990
Who's the Canuck with all the luck?

1258
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:19,200
Caboom?

1259
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,450
Who's the greatest of the Great White North?

1260
00:58:21,450 --> 00:58:22,200
Caboom!

1261
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,870
Who's the most spectacular daredevil Canada has ever seen?

1262
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,460
Duke Caboom!

1263
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:28,920
Can you do the jump?

1264
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,170
Yes, I Canada!

1265
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,340
We've got our ride.

1266
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:39,180
Yee-haw!

1267
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,260
Yo, Bo!

1268
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:42,260
Gigs! You made it!

1269
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:43,890
Good work!

1270
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:45,350
How'd you get it?

1271
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:47,560
How do we get that key?

1272
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,860
- It was hard. - Very difficult.

1273
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:56,440
- Barely made it out alive. - Yeah.

1274
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,610
So, you're welcome.

1275
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,030
Okay. Let's do this.

1276
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,120
Let me wrap that up for you.

1277
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,950
Don't want anything to happen to it on the way home.

1278
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:07,290
Good. That sale buys us some time.

1279
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:10,540
Wait for it.

1280
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,170
All right, let's go!

1283
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:57,170
So, how long were you in here?

1284
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:59,050
I don't know. Couple years.

1285
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:02,090
I didn't wanna sit on a shelf waiting for my life to happen.

1286
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:03,970
So, I left.

1287
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,720
You've handled this lost toy life better than I could.

1288
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,220
Sheriff.

1289
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:11,140
You're selling yourself short.

1290
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:15,560
I think you'd make a great lost toy.

1292
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:17,780
You really don't think

1293
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:20,110
you'll ever be in a kid's room again, huh?

1294
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:20,860
Nope.

1295
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:22,400
And now with the carnival traveling through,

1296
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,740
it's our chance to hop a ride...

1297
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:26,120
- and leave town. - You're leaving?

1298
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:26,870
Sure am.

1299
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:29,330
You ever think about getting out there, seeing the world?

1300
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:30,580
Without a kid?

1301
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:34,290
No. You can't teach this old toy new tricks.

1302
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:36,000
You'd be surprised.

1303
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:40,710
So, how'd you end up in this store in the first place?

1304
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,220
Well, I saw your lamp in the window...

1305
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:46,890
and I thought maybe you were inside...

1306
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:48,850
and so I, uh...

1307
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:58,270
Will you look at that?

1308
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:02,360
This is the only part of the store I ever liked.

1309
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:13,830
That's gonna be quite a jump for you and Duke.

1310
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:16,460
For me?

1311
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,670
Didn't I tell you? You're going with him.

1312
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:23,670
I am?

1313
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:25,380
Let's caboom.

1314
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:27,260
It'll be fine, Duke's the best.

1315
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:29,220
Yeah, at crashing.

1316
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:34,430
And now!

1317
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:37,480
Go!

1318
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:47,990
Rejean.

1319
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,830
It's a commercial. It's not real!

1320
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:53,620
I can't do this! I'm sorry, Rejean!

1321
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:56,290
No, no, no!

1322
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,420
What's new, pussycat?

1323
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:17,980
- Forky? - Girls?

1324
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:19,770
Forky, where are you?

1326
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:21,480
You're never gonna find me.

1327
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,360
Forky?

1328
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:25,940
Woody! How'd you find me?

1329
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:27,950
- Bo, I found him! - Hi.

1330
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:30,660
Wait, it's an actual fork?

1331
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:32,410
Bo! Bo! Bo!

1332
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:33,870
Buzz! The dummies are gone!

1333
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:36,460
What? Where'd they go?

1334
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,000
Okay, we can go now!

1335
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,590
- No. I need to find my girls. - Hello, Woody.

1336
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:42,790
Hi, Bo.

1337
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,090
- Where are my sheep - Yeah!

1338
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:45,760
Look! Woody found me!

1339
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,090
Take the bunny! I'm too cute to die!

1340
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,180
No, no!

1341
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:53,220
Woody!

1342
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:54,430
I just wanna talk.

1343
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:56,600
Yeah, with my voice box!

1344
01:02:57,770 --> 01:02:58,520
Pull!

1345
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:03,980
You're my favorite deputy.

1346
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:06,360
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.

1347
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,110
I'd like to join your posse.

1348
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:11,070
Reach for the sky!

1349
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:23,250
Girls!

1350
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:24,090
Drop it.

1351
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:29,920
No! No! Forky!

1352
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:31,590
- We've got to go! - Wait!

1353
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:33,800
Forky!

1354
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:37,060
Woody!

1355
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,820
Bonnie's backpack?

1356
01:03:58,950 --> 01:04:00,000
Giggle!

1357
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:03,540
Don't let Woody leave!

1358
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:07,750
Grab on!

1359
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:14,010
Duke, get us out of here!

1360
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:14,760
Oui!

1361
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,640
Here, kitty, kitty!

1362
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:19,600
Wait! We don't have Forky!

1363
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,140
Woody!

1364
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:26,060
Forky!

1365
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:46,630
Is everyone okay?

1366
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:54,300
- It's okay. - It's okay.

1367
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,760
Bunny? Bunny!

1368
01:04:57,430 --> 01:05:00,430
Bunny! No, no, no, no.

1369
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:04,270
No, no, no, no.

1370
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:06,230
- Bunny! - It's gonna be okay.

1371
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:07,110
Forky's still in there.

1372
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:07,560
If we hurry,

1373
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:08,980
we can get him before they lock him up.

1374
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:10,360
You want us to go back in there?

1375
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,650
We barely got out alive.

1376
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:12,780
Woody, it's better if we wait.

1377
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:15,030
No, no, no. There's no time. We can easily get back inside.

1378
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:15,660
But I saw Bonnie's...

1379
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:17,030
By my count, there were only four dummies.

1380
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:17,370
But the backpack...

1381
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:19,200
We outnumber them. So we have the advantage.

1382
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,160
Woody, look at us!

1383
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:26,500
Nobody is with you. It's over, okay?

1384
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:29,170
No. No, no, no. We are wasting time. We can do this.

1385
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:31,090
- Come on, Pull-string. - It's not worth it.

1386
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:32,420
Yeah, yes, listen to her!

1387
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:34,130
- Nobody wants this! - I do!

1388
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,470
- Why? - Because!

1389
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:37,220
- Why? - Just because!

1390
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:37,800
Why?

1391
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:40,310
Because it's all I have left to do!

1392
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,310
I don't have anything else.

1393
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,770
So, the rest of us don't count?

1394
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,440
That's not what I meant.

1395
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:51,860
Bonnie needs Forky.

1396
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:54,240
No. You need Bonnie!

1397
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:55,820
Open your eyes, Woody.

1398
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:57,820
There's plenty of kids out there.

1399
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:01,660
It can't be just about the one you're still clinging to.

1400
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:03,870
It's called loyalty.

1401
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:06,670
Something a lost toy wouldn't understand.

1402
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,170
I'm not the one who's lost.

1403
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:18,930
Let's get out of here.

1404
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:21,430
We've got a carnival that leaves in the morning.

1405
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:22,510
Come on.

1406
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:25,850
We'll find our own kid.

1407
01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:26,890
You're crazy.

1408
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,270
Bo!

1409
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:34,440
Bye, Woody. Good luck with Bonnie.

1410
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,030
Woody, you did all you could.

1411
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:44,870
Time to go home.

1412
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:46,410
No.

1413
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,540
- Woody. - I don't leave toys behind, Buzz.

1414
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:50,540
Yeah, but, Woody, you're actually leaving...

1415
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:52,750
Not now. Not ever.

1416
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:56,380
And he left me behind.

1417
01:06:57,590 --> 01:06:59,010
What now, inner voice?

1418
01:06:59,010 --> 01:07:00,930
Mission accomplished. Return to base.

1419
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:03,350
Go back to the RV? What about Woody?

1420
01:07:03,350 --> 01:07:05,180
We're going home, space ranger.

1421
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:06,310
Fall back, this planet...

1422
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:07,430
Retreat! There's too...

1423
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:09,810
Go! Time to fly! Exit the... Back... Run...

1424
01:07:09,810 --> 01:07:11,560
Get out! Returning to Star Command.

1425
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,940
Okay. Okay.

1426
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:17,570
Thanks a lot, inner voice.

1427
01:07:18,570 --> 01:07:22,280
Harmony, honey, help Grandma close up for the night.

1428
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:25,410
Okay. Then can we go to the carnival?

1429
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:26,200
Sure.

1430
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:33,250
Hello, Woody.

1431
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:36,050
I knew you'd be back.

1432
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:38,590
You don't know me.

1433
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:39,970
But I do.

1434
01:07:40,550 --> 01:07:44,100
You were left in the closet, feeling useless...

1435
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:46,260
wondering if you'll ever get played with.

1436
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:48,310
I'm not leaving without Forky.

1437
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:50,770
Can we agree on just one thing?

1438
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:51,890
What?

1439
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:54,020
That being there for a child

1440
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:57,110
is the most noble thing a toy can do.

1441
01:07:59,070 --> 01:07:59,900
Okay.

1442
01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:05,660
I was defective right out of the box.

1443
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:09,580
I can only imagine what it must have been like for you.

1444
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:13,080
All that time you spent with Andy...

1445
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,750
riding a bike with him for the first time...

1446
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,800
comforting him when he skinned his knee...

1447
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,180
proudly watching him grow up.

1448
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:28,010
And then you got a second chance with Bonnie...

1449
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:31,310
giving her comfort when she's scared at school...

1450
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:34,150
helping her when she needs it most.

1451
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:38,070
You've been there through all their ups and downs.

1452
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,280
Please.

1453
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:43,410
Be honest with me.

1454
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:47,870
Was it as wonderful as it sounds?

1455
01:08:51,870 --> 01:08:52,870
It was.

1456
01:08:56,710 --> 01:09:00,590
All I want is a chance for just one of those moments.

1457
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:07,010
I'd give anything to be loved the way you have.

1458
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:14,890
Just leave me Forky.

1459
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:17,610
Bonnie needs him.

1460
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:20,570
Of course.

1462
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,910
The flat tire is fixed!

1463
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:37,250
Come on, Woody, hurry up.

1464
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:38,540
Where is he?

1465
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:41,300
- Buzz! - Buzz!

1466
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:42,840
- Where's Woody? - And Forky?

1467
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:43,800
We have a situation.

1468
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,800
They need to be extracted from the antique store.

1469
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:47,050
How do we do that?

1470
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:49,390
Okay, let's make sure we have everything.

1471
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:50,390
Finally.

1472
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:51,560
It's okay.

1473
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:54,600
Any minute now... Bonnie will notice her backpack is missing.

1474
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,730
She'll realize she left it at the antique store...

1475
01:09:56,730 --> 01:09:58,730
and we'll head back in there.

1476
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:00,360
Okay. Looks like we have everything.

1477
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,070
- You good, Bonnie? - Yup.

1478
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:03,690
Great. Let's get out of here.

1479
01:10:04,650 --> 01:10:06,820
Okay, genius, what do we do now?

1480
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:08,820
Scanning perimeter.

1481
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:09,740
Laser at full power!

1482
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:12,080
- Buzz, what are you doing? - I'm thinking.

1483
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:13,870
Honey, will you please shut that toy off?

1484
01:10:13,870 --> 01:10:14,950
Yeah, I got it.

1485
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,960
Attack! Meteor shower! Look out!

1486
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,790
It's a secret mission in uncharted space!

1487
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:19,670
Let's go!

1488
01:10:19,670 --> 01:10:21,800
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

1489
01:10:22,210 --> 01:10:24,460
- Bonnie, how do you turn this off? - Full speed ahead!

1490
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:26,090
- Open the pod bay doors! - I don't know.

1491
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:28,130
It's just you and me now, cadet.

1492
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,180
A distress signal is coming from that rocket.

1493
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:30,850
Just toss it in the drawer.

1494
01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:34,270
To infinity and beyond!

1495
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,770
Your backpack's in the antique store! Let's go!

1496
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:38,440
Oh, no, my backpack!

1497
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:41,610
I left my backpack in the antique store!

1498
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:42,320
You did?

1499
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:45,820
All right, let's swing by and get it.

1500
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:53,530
I can't believe the nerve of that cowboy.

1501
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:55,410
I mean, who does he think he is?

1502
01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:56,330
Exactly!

1503
01:10:56,330 --> 01:10:58,160
He was way out of line.

1504
01:10:58,170 --> 01:11:00,290
You did the right thing leaving him behind.

1505
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:02,710
Lamb Chops?

1506
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,300
Coast is clear.

1507
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:11,180
Head to the middle.

1508
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:12,470
When the carnival leaves tomorrow,

1509
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:14,060
we'll hide right there.

1510
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:17,890
- No way! - Stuff that.

1511
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:18,560
Awesome.

1512
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,060
Stick with me. You'll be fine.

1513
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:20,850
- Ready? - No!

1514
01:11:20,850 --> 01:11:21,770
And another thing,

1515
01:11:21,770 --> 01:11:23,650
- Woody asked you for help. - On your mark...

1516
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:24,860
And he treats you like that?

1517
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:27,190
- Get set... - He only cares about himself.

1518
01:11:27,190 --> 01:11:28,110
No!

1519
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:29,110
You're wrong.

1520
01:11:29,110 --> 01:11:31,280
Woody's always trying to do right by his kid.

1521
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,240
By putting everyone in danger.

1522
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:35,490
That kind of crazy loyalty just...

1523
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:37,500
You got to love him for it.

1524
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:38,580
Say what now?

1525
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:40,960
Bo! What's the plan?

1526
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,250
Fill me in here.

1527
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:49,260
Get in! We're going back.

1528
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:50,300
We just got here.

1529
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:52,130
You heard Bo! We're going back!

1530
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:54,350
Move your plush! Let's ride!

1531
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:03,400
You're my favorite...

1532
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:17,700
Yay!

1533
01:12:19,330 --> 01:12:20,870
You are my best friend.

1534
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:22,420
Let's play all day!

1535
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:24,380
Benson! Did you hear that?

1536
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:25,790
Isn't that lovely?

1537
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,130
Time for tea.

1538
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:29,510
Thank you, Woody. Thank you!

1539
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:31,670
All my dreams are coming true because of you.

1540
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:32,970
Thank you! Thank you!

1541
01:12:32,970 --> 01:12:34,010
You're welcome.

1542
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,220
It's time, Benson.

1543
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:40,600
Goodbye, Forky. I'm going to miss our talks.

1544
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:43,270
Me, too. Good luck, Gabby.

1545
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:45,100
Thank you, my little utensil.

1546
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:49,230
Bye, Gabby! Goodbye, Benson!

1547
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:52,320
He is terrifying.

1548
01:12:53,530 --> 01:12:55,200
- Hello. - Hi.

1549
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:56,740
- Bonnie? - Can I help you with anything?

1550
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:58,580
Yeah. We called about the backpack.

1551
01:12:58,580 --> 01:13:01,080
Yes. I couldn't find it.

1552
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,000
Feel free to look around.

1553
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,500
Quick! Before she finds it!

1554
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,500
Look! There's Harmony.

1555
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:13,920
You make me so happy!

1556
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:15,550
Let's be best friends.

1557
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:17,720
This is it!

1558
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:19,180
We're going home, Forky!

1559
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:23,060
Forky!

1560
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,730
No, no, no. Woody, look! It's really happening!

1561
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:36,450
I'm Gabby Gabby, and I love you.

1562
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,780
I'm gonna cry.

1563
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:44,910
What have you got there?

1564
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:47,210
I found this old doll.

1565
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:49,920
You can take it home if you want.

1566
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:52,630
Nah.

1567
01:14:00,430 --> 01:14:03,180
What happened? Gabby was supposed to be her toy.

1568
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:04,680
There's my backpack!

1569
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:06,390
Mom, it's over here.

1570
01:14:11,270 --> 01:14:12,530
Forky!

1571
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:14,150
Mom, I found him!

1572
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:15,900
There he is!

1573
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:17,320
Now, please leave him in there,

1574
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,070
so he doesn't get lost again.

1575
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,540
But what about Gabby?

1576
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:30,840
Forky, listen to me very carefully.

1577
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:32,000
This is important.

1578
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,880
Tell Buzz to get the RV to the merry-go-round.

1579
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:35,670
You understand?

1580
01:14:35,670 --> 01:14:38,510
Absolutely. What is a merry-go-round?

1581
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:41,050
The spinny ride with lights and horses.

1582
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:42,640
- You mean a carousel. - Yes!

1583
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:44,850
Carousel. Yes! Meet me at the carousel.

1584
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:45,640
Got it.

1586
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:01,740
Gabby! Gabby!

1587
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:04,630
You can have your voice box back.

1588
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:07,970
I don't need it anymore.

1589
01:15:08,110 --> 01:15:09,020
Yes, you do.

1590
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:11,190
Harmony wasn't your only chance, Gabby,

1591
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:12,510
but we have to hurry. Come on.

1592
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:16,130
No. Harmony was my chance.

1593
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:18,030
My time's over.

1594
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:20,310
Now, please go away.

1595
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:33,780
You hear that?

1596
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,290
A friend once told me...

1597
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:44,750
"There are plenty of kids out there."

1598
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:48,800
And one of them is named Bonnie.

1599
01:15:50,690 --> 01:15:53,320
She's waiting for you, right now.

1600
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:56,460
She just doesn't know it yet.

1601
01:15:58,740 --> 01:16:00,540
What if you're wrong?

1602
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:04,960
Well, if you sit on a shelf the rest of your life...

1603
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,090
you'll never find out, will you?

1604
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:11,620
He's right.

1605
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:14,630
I learned that from the best.

1606
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:19,980
Come on, Gabby.

1607
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:22,610
Let's get you to Bonnie.

1608
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:30,500
The carousel?

1609
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:33,330
Yeah, it's the spinny ride with lights and horses.

1610
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:35,200
Woody said to meet him there.

1611
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,000
- You got to be kidding! - How do we do that?

1612
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:37,910
We could...

1613
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:39,480
We are not sending Dad to jail.

1614
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:40,730
You're no fun.

1615
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:43,810
Left turn in 0.5 miles.

1616
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:46,510
Wait a second. I have an idea.

1617
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:58,520
Skunk!

1618
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:13,040
Too many people. Gonna need an alternate route.

1619
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:15,150
Will we make it to the carousel in time?

1620
01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:20,870
Yes, we Canada!

1621
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:22,580
What? What is it?

1622
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:31,850
Recalculating. Take a right.

1623
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:33,240
What? A right?

1624
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:35,140
Right turn ahead.

1625
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,920
Does the GPS sound funny to you?

1626
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,860
Honey, it's fine. Just drive.

1627
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:40,390
I thought it sounded funny.

1628
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:44,650
Another right!

1629
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:47,170
- Right. - Take another right.

1630
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:48,590
Another right, really?

1631
01:17:48,650 --> 01:17:49,760
- Turn right! - Now!

1632
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:50,630
Turn right!

1633
01:17:53,070 --> 01:17:55,450
- We're headin' back. - There's the carousel!

1634
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:57,620
Do you think Woody will get there in time?

1635
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:00,680
Nope. Forget it. Never. No. No way. Declined.

1636
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:02,440
- No dice. Rejected. - Duke, Duke, you got this.

1637
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,310
This is the fastest way to the carousel.

1638
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:05,660
You made the last jump.

1639
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:07,910
Yeah, but that was 4 feet. This is 40!

1640
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:11,330
Exactly! Duke Caboom would never repeat a stunt.

1641
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:13,250
- No. He'd never do that. - No, no, no.

1642
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:16,230
He's the toy that went on to crash 40 feet

1644
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:18,140
into that target!

1645
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,330
Yeah, he is.

1646
01:18:20,710 --> 01:18:22,060
I'm Duke Caboom!

1647
01:18:22,270 --> 01:18:24,180
Oh, man. I can do this!

1648
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:25,500
Yes, you Canada!

1649
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,010
I can do it with my eyes closed.

1650
01:18:27,010 --> 01:18:27,810
Yes, you... What?

1651
01:18:27,810 --> 01:18:29,270
- Three, two, one. Go! - What! No, wait!

1652
01:18:35,570 --> 01:18:37,330
- What is he doing? - Oh, no.

1653
01:18:48,010 --> 01:18:50,080
This is for you, Rejean.

1655
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:56,620
Caboom.

1656
01:19:00,550 --> 01:19:01,270
Yes!

1657
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:02,460
He did it!

1658
01:19:02,650 --> 01:19:03,700
All right, our turn!

1659
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:05,500
You heard the sheriff. Let's go.

1660
01:19:15,830 --> 01:19:17,280
Another right!

1661
01:19:17,330 --> 01:19:19,120
Another right? That's the wrong way.

1662
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,050
- Are you sure? - Stupid rental.

1663
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:22,510
- I'm turning us around. - No!

1664
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:24,060
Recalculating.

1665
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:25,260
Turn right.

1666
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,940
- Must be broken. - No! No!

1667
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:33,360
What is happening?

1668
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:34,430
Honey, what are you doing? Slow down!

1669
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:35,710
I can't! I can't!

1670
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:37,500
- Press the brake. - I'm trying.

1671
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:38,200
Press it!

1672
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:47,250
Got a visual on the RV, heading southbound.

1673
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:54,790
Gabby?

1674
01:19:57,350 --> 01:19:58,110
Gabby?

1675
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:03,930
I think she's lost.

1676
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:20,150
Are you sure?

1677
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:32,720
Change of plans.

1678
01:20:38,430 --> 01:20:39,760
Pull over.

1679
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:42,290
I can't! This is a rental!

1680
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:44,030
I don't know what's happening!

1681
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,020
I'm so nervous.

1682
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:58,560
- What if she doesn't like me? - Gabby.

1683
01:20:58,560 --> 01:20:59,730
I don't know if I can do this.

1684
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:02,720
Gabby, it's just like you said.

1685
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:06,360
This is the most noble thing a toy can do.

1686
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:15,120
Okay. Just edge yourself a bit into the light.

1687
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:19,310
Not too far.

1688
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:20,730
That's it.

1689
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:23,580
Perfect.

1690
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,110
Winner, winner... Chicken dinner.

1691
01:21:49,470 --> 01:21:51,070
Are you lost, too?

1692
01:21:55,150 --> 01:21:58,100
I'm Gabby Gabby. Will you be my friend?

1693
01:21:59,010 --> 01:22:00,060
I'll help you.

1694
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:11,300
Excuse me, can you... Can you help us?

1695
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:12,830
Honey, what's wrong?

1696
01:22:12,830 --> 01:22:14,660
I can't find my mom and dad.

1697
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:16,430
It's okay. I'll help you find them.

1698
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:17,630
I'm sure they're not far.

1699
01:22:17,950 --> 01:22:19,280
She was right next to us.

1700
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:20,490
She was right here!

1701
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,000
And I looked away for one second.

1702
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:22,790
Mommy!

1703
01:22:31,150 --> 01:22:32,420
I couldn't find you...

1704
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:34,280
and then I found this doll.

1705
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:35,190
You did?

1706
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:37,010
Her name is Gabby Gabby.

1707
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:51,580
We actually did that.

1708
01:22:52,090 --> 01:22:54,320
- Oh, yeah. - Yes!

1709
01:22:54,650 --> 01:22:55,910
That was amazing.

1710
01:22:56,890 --> 01:22:58,150
We make a great team, guys.

1711
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:02,600
Pull over now!

1712
01:23:04,510 --> 01:23:06,360
Almost there.

1713
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,310
- Stop! - Stop!

1714
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:15,360
Are we home?

1715
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:22,020
Sir, will you please step out of the vehicle?

1716
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:24,370
Dad's totally going to jail.

1717
01:23:30,770 --> 01:23:32,460
Everyone, topside. Let's move.

1718
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:35,410
Forky, I've got a very important job for you.

1719
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:36,690
For me?

1720
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:38,180
Have a good night.

1721
01:23:41,310 --> 01:23:42,170
What the...?

1722
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:45,390
You've got to be kidding me.

1723
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:05,050
So long, cowboy.

1724
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:06,580
Happy trails.

1725
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:15,470
Billy, Goat, Gruff. Take care of her, girls.

1726
01:24:22,530 --> 01:24:24,430
I'm glad I got to see you again.

1727
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:28,100
I... I don't...

1728
01:24:54,730 --> 01:24:55,710
Goodbye, Bo.

1729
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:23,530
Buzz, I... I...

1730
01:25:25,010 --> 01:25:26,150
She'll be okay.

1731
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:32,420
Bonnie will be okay.

1732
01:25:38,830 --> 01:25:39,770
You sure?

1733
01:25:41,090 --> 01:25:42,810
Listen to your inner voice.

1734
01:26:12,930 --> 01:26:13,720
Bo?

1735
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:15,330
Is it really her?

1736
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:16,610
I'll be danged, it's Bo!

1737
01:26:17,220 --> 01:26:18,110
Jessie.

1738
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:19,990
Bo!

1739
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:23,330
So long, Forky.

1740
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:27,970
Forky! Who's watching the doors?

1741
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:31,110
- Go, go, go! - Oh, boy.

1742
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:35,080
Oh, my goodness. The awning. What is going on?

1743
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:12,380
Does this mean Woody's a lost toy?

1744
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:13,950
He's not lost.

1745
01:28:14,930 --> 01:28:15,880
Not anymore.

1746
01:28:18,390 --> 01:28:22,250
- To infinity... - And beyond.

1748
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:23,920
There goes another one.

1749
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:25,560
We're never getting outta here.

1750
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:26,870
Frog legs.

1751
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,210
Up here, Rainbow Connection.

1752
01:29:28,210 --> 01:29:31,020
You Mr. Toads wanna take a wild ride with a kid?

1753
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:32,110
We can make that happen.

1754
01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:33,250
- You can? - Really?

1755
01:29:33,250 --> 01:29:35,480
Oh, yeah! Leave it to us, Jeremiah.

1756
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:20,080
All right. Nice job, gang!

1757
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:21,600
Every prize with a kid.

1758
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,080
- What's next - Leave that to us.

1759
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:24,710
We know exactly what to do.

1760
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:03,980
Plush Rush!

1761
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:05,910
How you like that, huh?

1762
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:08,580
You got plush-rushed, son!

1763
01:31:08,910 --> 01:31:09,730
Dance!

1764
01:31:10,810 --> 01:31:12,790
Dance! Get those knees up!

1765
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,590
Let's see those feet move!

1766
01:31:28,430 --> 01:31:31,110
Or we can get more toys to kids.

1767
01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:32,660
Yeah, let's do that.

1768
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:37,160
Do you really have laser eyes?

1769
01:31:39,390 --> 01:31:40,130
Yeah.

1770
01:32:09,410 --> 01:32:11,100
Hi, toys. Bye, toys.

1771
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:13,220
Jessie's back!

1772
01:32:13,220 --> 01:32:15,220
What's first grade like? Tell me everything!

1773
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:16,120
Well, it was...

1774
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:17,650
How was "Present and Explain"?

1775
01:32:17,650 --> 01:32:19,340
You mean "Show and Tell" there, big guy.

1776
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:20,820
You see any kids eat paste?

1777
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:21,860
Guys, listen!

1778
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:24,440
Bonnie had a great day in first grade.

1779
01:32:24,510 --> 01:32:26,630
She even made a new friend in class.

1780
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:28,880
She's already making friends.

1781
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:32,030
No, no, she made a new friend.

1782
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:34,550
Come on out, it's okay.

1783
01:32:53,140 --> 01:32:56,360
Hi. I'm, uh... I'm Forky.

1784
01:32:57,780 --> 01:32:58,470
Trash?

1785
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:04,200
No, no. Toy. I am a... We are all toys.

1786
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:08,210
Unique, beautiful toys.

1787
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:11,590
I will explain everything.

1788
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:16,450
How am I alive?

1789
01:33:19,110 --> 01:33:20,740
I don't know.

1790
